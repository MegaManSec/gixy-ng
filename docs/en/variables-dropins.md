# Custom Variables & Drop-ins

`gixy` tries to resolve variables as it analyzes your NGINX config. When it sees a variable it does not recognize, it will warn -- not because your config is wrong, but because the scanner cannot safely tell what might flow into that value.

This comes up a lot with third-party modules and bespoke setups (for example variables like `$brotli_ratio`), or when your organization injects variables through templates.

Variable drop-ins are the solution to this: you provide a small directory of definitions, and `gixy` learns what those variables are supposed to look like.

Note: If you never see warnings about unknown variables, you probably don't need to use these.

## Enable drop-ins

Point `gixy` at one or more directories containing variable definition files.

CLI:

```bash
gixy --vars-dirs /etc/gixy/vars,~/.config/gixy/vars
```

Config file:

```ini
vars-dirs = [/etc/gixy/vars, ~/.config/gixy/vars]
```

`gixy` will read all files ending in `.cfg` or `.conf` inside those directories.

## File format

Each non-empty, non-comment line defines one variable:

```
name value
```

A few value styles are supported:

* **Quoted literal**: `'...'` or `"..."`
  Treated as a literal, fixed value.

* **Regex pattern**: `r'...'` or `r"..."`
  A regular expression describing what the value is allowed to contain.

* **none / null** (case-insensitive)
  Marks the variable as "non user-controlled" for the purpose of analysis.

Also:

* Blank lines are ignored
* Lines starting with `#` are ignored
* A trailing comma after the value is accepted (handy if you are copy/pasting)

### Examples

```cfg
# /etc/gixy/vars/nginx-module-brotli.cfg
brotli_ratio none

# /etc/gixy/vars/nginx-module-foo.cfg
foo_host "example.com"
foo_uri  r'/[^\s]*',
```

## Prefix variables

You can define variable *prefixes* by ending the name with an underscore `_`, similar to NGINX built-ins. For example, defining `http_` will match variables like `$http_user_agent`, `$http_x_forwarded_for`, and so on.

```cfg
# Treat any $http_* variable as present
http_ r'.+'
```
